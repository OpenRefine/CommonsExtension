# Releasing CommonsExtension

1. Make sure you are on the `master` branch and it is up to date (`git pull`)
2. Open `pom.xml` and set the version to the desired version number, such as `<version>0.1.0</version>`
3. Commit and push those changes to master
4. Create a new release on GitHub at https://github.com/OpenRefine/CommonsExtension/releases/new, providing a release title (such as "Commons extension 0.1.0") and a description of the features in this release. You can copy the content of the last release go get a starting template. Also create a new tag following the existing pattern.
